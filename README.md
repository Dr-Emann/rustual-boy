A WIP Virtual Boy emulator in Rust.

## Status

This emulator is in its early stages (including the title, which will probably change) and covers much of the CPU + memory mapping and some of the video hardware. Many ROM's are "compatible" so far, but considering timer and inputs aren't covered yet, that's not saying much :)

A more detailed status section will be written when the emu is complete enough for it to be relevant.
