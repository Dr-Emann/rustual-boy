## Description

Rustual Boy is a [Virtual Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy) emulator. It can be used to play existing Virtual Boy games, as well as be a helpful development/debugging tool for homebrew for this platform.

The name "Rustual Boy" is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of the words "Rust" and "Virtual Boy". Ok, the "Virtual Boy" part was obvious, but why "Rust"? In fact, Rustual Boy is written in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) - a "systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety." Rust is a wonderful language with a thriving community, and as such provides a fantastic platform for an emulation project!

## Status

Rustual Boy is currently able to emulate [the majority of commercial Virtual Boy titles](https://github.com/emu-rs/rustual-boy#known-game-compatibility), as well as many homebrew ones as well. It supports basic video/audio output and keyboard input, as well as a simple CLI debugger. It runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and likely other platforms Rust supports as well.

While Rustual Boy's core emulation is nearly complete [compatibility-wise](https://github.com/emu-rs/rustual-boy#known-game-compatibility), the project is still quite young, and needs some time to mature. Particularly, there are currently no binary distributions (only source), its user interface is lacking (read: virtually non-existent), and there are some known (and probably unknown) stability/compatibility issues. Also, performance isn't fantastic yet, but the emulator should be playable at least.

That said, these things are bound to improve with time, and everyone is encouraged to [build the emulator](https://github.com/emu-rs/rustual-boy#building-and-running), give it a shot, and [report any bugs/feature requests](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Building and running

Currently, the only dependency for building is Rust itself, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html). Once that's installed, you can clone the repo, and simply `cargo build`/`cargo run` your way to victory! It's recommended to use the `--release` flag as well, as emulation can require a lot of CPU power, so we'll want all the compiler help we can get.

If you're new to using Cargo (Rust's build system), it's recommended to give the [Cargo Guide](http://doc.crates.io/guide.html) a quick skim.
